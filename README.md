One-to-One Explanation of Core Logic
This portfolio website is built using simple front-end web technologies, with a focus on design and user experience. Below are some of the key features and how they work.

# 1. Project Section:
The project section displays individual cards for each project. Each card includes a title, description, and links to the project’s GitHub repository or live demo.

html
Copy code
<div class="project-card">
    <h3>Project Name</h3>
    <p>A brief description of the project goes here.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/project-url" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
    <a href="https://project-live-url" target="_blank">Live Demo</a>
</div>
Each project is represented as a card, with links opening in new tabs.
2. Skills Section:
The skills section showcases your technical skills with icons and progress bars representing your proficiency in different technologies.

html
Copy code
<div class="skill">
    <i class="fab fa-html5"></i>
    <p>HTML5</p>
</div>
<div class="progress-bar">
    <div class="progress" style="width: 90%;"></div>
</div>
The progress-bar element visually displays the percentage of proficiency for each skill.
3. Responsive Design:
The website’s layout adjusts based on the screen size, making it mobile-friendly. This is achieved using Bootstrap’s grid system and CSS media queries.

css
Copy code
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .project-card {
        width: 100%;
        margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
}
This media query ensures that project cards are displayed in a single column on smaller screens.
4. Smooth Scrolling:
JavaScript is used to add smooth scrolling when clicking on navigation links, providing a seamless user experience.

javascript
Copy code
document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#"]').forEach(anchor => {
    anchor.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        document.querySelector(this.getAttribute('href')).scrollIntoView({
            behavior: 'smooth'
        });
    });
});
The script listens for anchor link clicks and scrolls to the target section smoothly.
5. Contact Form:
The contact form allows visitors to send messages directly from the website. You can integrate it with a service like Formspree to handle form submissions.

html
Copy code
<form action="https://formspree.io/your-email" method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required>
    <input type="email" name="_replyto" placeholder="Your Email" required>
    <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message" required></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
This form sends a message directly to your email when a visitor submits it.
